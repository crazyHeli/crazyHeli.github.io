                <p class="rule1">In this funny and amazing game your main task is to get as many points as possible! At the same time you have to avoid collisions with clouds and unidentified flying objects. It is not so easy as you can think! </p>
                <p class="rule1">With each level clouds will move faster and faster! At the beginning of the game you will have 3 lives, each of which you can lose because of the 2 clashes with clouds or UFO or 1 clash with mountains. On your way to the goal you will meet coins and other objects, that will give you points or lives or other super capabilities. With your enemies your can fight using your own bullets. For each target hit you'll get points!</p>
                <p class="rule1"> At some moment you can find yourself in a wonderful situation without UFOs and clouds, where you'll see 2 magic words
                    <p class="rolling">"ROLLING SCOPES"</p> where you'll be able just fly and collect coins! We wish you good luck! Have a good time and enjoy this game! :)</p>
